Today I decided that I wanted to build a cyberdeck. This cyberdeck will use my existing Raspberry Pi 4B as its base. The case will be 3d Printed. I want to have a keyboard, a small screen, and some form of battery. 
Time: 30 minutes.

I made a quick layout sketch in Excalidraw to help finalize my layout. I have decided that I don't want to use any hinges. I am probably going to use a cheap pocket keyboard fron Rii as my keybard and trackpad. I don't want a touchscreen though. I am going to use a USB battery bank for the battery. I will directly plug this into the Raspberry pi.
